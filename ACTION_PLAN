Here's a step-by-step outline for implementing the separation of concerns architecture:
Step 1: Define Component Composition

    Identify the components to be built
    Define the custom HTML elements, named and default slots for each component
    Write the HTML, CSS, and JS for each component (self-contained)

Step 2: Create Component Renderer

    Define the ComponentRenderer class
    Identify the responsibilities of the renderer (import resolution, state management, component lifecycle, rendering)
    Design the API for the renderer (methods, props, events)

Step 3: Implement Import Resolution

    Define how components will be imported (e.g., ES modules, dynamic imports)
    Implement import resolution logic in the ComponentRenderer class
    Handle dependencies and circular dependencies

Step 4: Implement State Management

    Define how component state will be managed (e.g., props, state objects)
    Implement state management logic in the ComponentRenderer class
    Handle state updates, props changes, and component re-renders

Step 5: Implement Component Lifecycle

    Define the component lifecycle events (e.g., creation, update, destruction)
    Implement lifecycle event handling in the ComponentRenderer class
    Handle component creation, updating, and destruction

Step 6: Implement Rendering

    Define how components will be rendered to the DOM
    Implement rendering logic in the ComponentRenderer class
    Handle rendering of nested components, slots, and conditional rendering

Step 7: Integrate Component Composition and Renderer

    Connect the component composition to the ComponentRenderer class
    Use the renderer to render components to the DOM
    Handle communication between components and the renderer

Step 8: Test and Refine

    Test the architecture with sample components and use cases
    Refine the implementation based on testing and feedback

This outline provides a theoretical framework for implementing the separation of concerns architecture. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
